                    for a defiled world,<br />
                    phantasmal beauty shining<br />
                    for a wounded heart,<br />
                    songs of anger resound
                    <br /><br />

                    Isiliel is the solo project for Himari Tsukishiro (NECRONOMIDOL).
                    <br /><br />
                    Mixing genres as diverse as folk, blackgaze and city pop via a worldwide team of veteran songwriters such as King Dude and NARASAKI of COALTAR OF THE DEEPERS, through Isiliel Himari will express hitherto unexplored depths of pathos and beauty on stage.
                    <br /><br />
