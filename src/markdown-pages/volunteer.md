SoCal IdolFest is a passion project founded by experienced event organizers. Our goal is to create an event space where idol fans of all types can gather and share in the unique joy that idols bring to our lives. Whether youâ€™re a long-time wota or just getting into the scene, NWIF has a place for you!

Volunteering for the 2023 event is now open!
