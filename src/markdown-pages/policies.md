## Welcome!

Welcome to SoCal IdolFest (SCIF)! We are a group of passionate idol fans working to bring idol culture and programming to the US. The primary purpose of SCIF is for the attendees to have fun. To make this happen, SCIF has established certain rules of conduct. These rules were created to ensure the behavior of any one individual or group of attendees does not disturb the enjoyment of another attendee, nor detract from the relaxed and comfortable atmosphere of the event. To both enjoy the convention to the fullest as well as to ensure the safety of all participants, please comply with staff instructions at all times.

SCIF welcomes everyone; however, the event's management reserves the right to deny or revoke the attendance of any individual, at any time, for any reason. This action may be undertaken when an individual's presence or behavior causes significant interference with event operations or adversely affects the organization's relationship with its guests or with its venue. SCIF also reserves the right to amend these rules at any time without prior or posted notice. If you have any questions, please [contact the event staff](/contact) for assistance.

Anyone who accepts a SCIF badge agrees to indemnify and hold harmless SCIF and its partner organizations from any claim for personal injuries or other damages or equity arising out of any individual's activities at SCIF, even if such injury or damage is caused by negligence by or on the part of SCIF.

## COVID-19

SCIF will release a full COVID policy no later than one month prior to the event.

COVID policies may change without notice, including during the event. SCIF will always seek to exceed minimum compliance with health regulations, as the health and safety of all attendees and staff are our #1 priority. Attendees are required to comply with all COVID-19 preventative measures.

## Anti-Harassment

If someone's behavior makes you feel unwelcome, unsafe, or uncomfortable, that is harassment. SCIF does not allow harassment of any kind, including but not limited to behaviors such as: stalking, offensive comments, hate speech, bathroom policing, inappropriate or unwelcome physical contact, recording or taking pictures without permission, and repeatedly disrupting conversations you have been asked to leave. The aforementioned comments or hate speech could be in relation to: age, race or ethnicity, color, citizenship or national origin, relationship status, sexual orientation, gender identity or presentation, appearance, clothing, body size, pregnancy, disability, or religion. This list is not an exhaustive list.

Keep your hands to yourself. Respect your fellow attendees. Keep an eye on what you say to people and how you act around them. Take notice of people's pronouns and use them. Remember, cosplay is not consent: just because someone is in costume, it doesn't give you permission to take a picture or touch their costume. Ask first, and if they tell you no, respect that.

If you feel harassed or see someone else being harassed, notify a staff member immediately. You are also within your rights to ask the harasser to stop on your own. Once notified, SCIF staff will take any action necessary to stop the behavior, up to and including badge revocation and expulsion from convention premises. We will also take steps to help you feel safe again at your request, such as escorting you to a place you feel safe, contacting your friends or family for you, or contacting local law enforcement.

This policy applies without exception to everyone at the convention, including attendees, panelists, vendors, guests, convention staff, and venue staff.

## Minor Attendees

All attendees who are under 18 during any time they are at SCIF are required to provide a consent form signed by a legal guardian. The consent form can be downloaded [here](/Parental%20Consent%20Form.pdf). If the legal guardian will be present at the event with the minor, then the form can be signed in front of us. If the legal guardian will not be in attendance, the form may be brought pre-signed.

Minors ages 13-17 may attend SCIF without accompaniment, so long as they have a completed consent form. Minors 12 years of age and under must be accompanied at all times by an adult with a paid badge.

School IDs are accepted as proof of ID, or, if accompanied by an adult, the adult's ID may be accepted instead.

Attendees under the age of 18 are permitted to present either proof of vaccination or a negative test administered within the last 72 hours by an authorized medical professional. Rapid tests administered at home are not accepted.

## Content Rating

All content at SCIF is expected to fall within a PG-13 rating unless otherwise approved by event chairs. Any content deemed inappropriate will be asked to be removed from the convention space. This includes any imagery or discussion of drugs, alcohol, sex, or violence. If you are unsure if your content complies with our policies, please ask a staff member!

## Badges

Badges must be visibly displayed on your person while in event space. In case of lost badge, one $20 replacement will be available with presentation of photo ID. Additional replacements will be charged full price.

If you are unable to attend due to border closures or other government restrictions, you may request a refund for your badge. Refunds are offered on a case-by-case basis, and documentation may be requested confirming your situation. To request a refund, email [registration@scidolfest.com](mailto:registration@scidolfest.com) no later than August 10th, 2022. Refund requests made after this date will not be considered. Refunds are offered at the sole discretion of SCIF and its partner organizations.

## Lost Items

In the case of lost items, please reach out to venue staff or call the front desk. SCIF does not operate a Lost & Found and is not responsible for any personal belongings that may be lost, damaged, or stolen during the event.

## venue & State Rules

You must comply with venue and government rules while on venue premises. What’s illegal outside the venue is illegal inside the venue. Please follow any instructions given to you by members of venue staff. If you have concerns, contact any SCIF staff member.

Do not stick anything to venue walls. Any unapproved material on venue walls will be removed, and any damage caused will be the responsibility of the poster. Flyer distributions are allowed as long as they comply with a PG-13 content rating.

## Cosplay

We’re excited to see cosplayers sharing their love of anime and idols! Keep the following rules in mind when designing your costume or cosplay:

*   Footwear is required at all times. Socks are not footwear. If you are cosplaying a character that’s barefoot, check out this tutorial on how to make [“invisible shoes”](https://www.andsewingishalfthebattle.com/invisible-shoes/).
*   Costumes and regular clothing should not expose the body in a way that would be deemed as indecent exposure. Private parts must be covered in an opaque material that will not slip or have gaps.
*   Costumes worn in the event space can not be so large that they obstruct or impede the flow of traffic or entryways for all attendee’s safety. If the costume cannot fit through a standard doorway, you may be asked to store it. Exceptions may be made for Masquerade contestants.
*   Attendees with bulky costumes, costumes that obscure vision, or costumes with large extensions such as wings or spikes, should have a designated “handler,” to assist them through the hallways and crowds.
*   Functioning wheels cannot be used as part of a costume or prop (i.e. anything that you might ride, push, or pull). Costumes made with wheelchairs in mind are an exception as long as they do not impede traffic flow.
*   No costumes may be realistic depictions of American law enforcement, current American military uniforms, first responders, emergency medical personnel, or any official government agent.
*   Costumes may not target or harass any specific person, culture, nationality, or anything else that may come off as rude or inappropriate. Our anti-harassment policy applies at all times.

## Accessibility

SCIF is committed to making our event accessible to all. Our approach to some accessibility needs are detailed below, but this is not a complete list. If you have further accessibility needs, please [contact us](/contact)! 

In accordance with the ADA, service animals are permitted in venue and event space. Non-service animals may be permitted in venue common areas and rooms but are not permitted in SCIF event space. Please contact the venue directly for any questions relating to their pet policy.

If you are d/Deaf or hard of hearing, we are happy to provide accommodations such as ASL interpretation or live captioning to make our content accessible to you. Please request these services with a minimum of one month’s notice.

Our concert may use strobe lights. A warning sign will be posted on the door of the Main Auditorium during the concert indicating that flashing lights may be in use. If you are photosensitive and would like to attend the concert, please let us know ahead of time so we can review the lighting plan with you.

## Photos & Videos

SCIF attendees should be aware that audio and/or video recordings are frequently made in convention areas and that their likenesses may appear in those recordings. Individual members agree to assign without compensation the use of their likeness(es) at SCIF for the use of promotional material such as highlights and videos.

Everyone must comply with the SCIF anti-harassment policy when taking photos or videos of others. Be respectful and remember cosplay is not consent.

Some performances may not permit recording. Details will be announced closer to the event.

This policy is specific to attendees. SCIF has staff photographers, who may take audio/video recordings during times when attendees are not permitted to record.

If you are taking photos for personal use, we request that you give staff photographers priority and move out of their shot if asked. Thank you!
